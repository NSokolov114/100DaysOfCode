Finally I have quit my job at VNIIGAZ. I've been working there as a research scientist since 2015. I took a couple weeks off and now I'm ready for the code challenge. Time to refresh the knowledge I got in the last 6 months and push forward!  
I chose the courses I want to complete and a number of projects I can work on. Fixed the challenge rules and resources.  
Signed up for front-end courses on foxminded. They do code review via GitLab, so my commits won't show there. I'll be coding on top of those courses.
