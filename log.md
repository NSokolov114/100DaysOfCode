# 100DaysOfCode - Log

### Day 0: May 23, 2021 
Finally I have quit my job at VNIIGAZ. I've been working there as a research scientist since 2015. I took two weeks off and now I'm ready for the code challenge. Time to refresh the knowledge I got in the last 6 months and push forward!  
Today I chose the courses I want to complete and a number of projects I can work on.

### Day 1: May 24, 2021
Fixed the challenge rules and resources.
