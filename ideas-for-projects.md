# List of my ideas for projects


### Game - Hangman
I wrote hangman in Python, now I can implement the same logic in a web page. I also have the dictionary ready.

### Game - Match Pairs
Classic Pairs game, but with WoW:TBC icons. Or WoW in general  
It might be interesting.  
Different classes, different icons.

### Tracking / habit app
An app where you can track how much time did you spend each day on different stuff.  
Maybe with a rulebook and links to extra info.  
A heat map of progress (like on GitHub, but 1 line for tracking 1 habit)  
It's not convenient to track the time of activities on the go on web, so either make it very mobile friendly, on focus on the rulebook aspect.  

### Alloyant periodic table
For material scientists - periodic table where you can click and see which elements do what when added to the steel as an alloyants.  
Simple, but can make it cute and unique - I haven't been able to find something like that.

### Visualisation for all sorting algorithms
There are a few good websites already, so this one is just for me. But it'd help me to really understand how they work.

### Portfolio website
Well, I need a personal website showing what I can do, not just GitHub.


### Personal Photosite
Simple (only HTML+CSS) but beautiful 1-page site showing a few of my photos represented on Unsplash.  
Carousel - radio buttons, arrows left/right.  
Why? Just to show off...
