# List of my ideas for projects

### Game - Hangman
I wrote hangman in Python, now I can implement the same logic in a web page. I also have the dictionary ready.
### Game - Match Pairs
Classic Pairs game, but with WoW:TBC icons. Or WoW in general  
It might be interesting.  
Different classes, different icons.
### Tracking / habit app
An app where you can track how much time did you spend each day on different stuff.  
Maybe with a rulebook and links to extra info.  
A heat map of progress (like on GitHub, but 1 line for tracking 1 habit)  
It's not convenient to track the time of activities on the go on web, so either make it very mobile friendly, on focus on the rulebook aspect.
