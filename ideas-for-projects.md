# List of my ideas for projects

### Game - Hangman
I wrote hangman in Python, now I can implement the same logic in a web page. I also have the dictionary ready.
### Game - Match Pairs
Classic Pairs game, but with WoW:TBC icons. Or WoW in general  
It might be interesting.  
Different classes, different icons.
