## Why do I need this challenge?
I've just quit my full-time job after 6 years of living by a schedule. I had to wake up at 6am 5/7 to go to work, go to bed early and walk at the least 10km to get to work and back home. I had to work, solve problems, manage myself and other people.  
Now I can do whatever I want and I don't want it to be just sitting all day playing WoW or whatever. It's just easier to be consistent at good things if I have a plan and a few checkboxes to check.
My goal is to get hired as a web developer ASAP.

## Expected outcome
1. After 100 days I want to be able to start applying for a web developer job.
2. And also I want to become healthier despite sitting and staring at the screen for all these hours.
